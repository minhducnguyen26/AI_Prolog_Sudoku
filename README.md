This project involves the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve the classical game of Sudoku. Sudoku is a popular puzzle game in which the player has to fill in a 9x9 grid with numbers 1-9 such that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all the numbers from 1-9 without any repetition. The AI will use Prolog to implement different strategies to solve a given Sudoku puzzle and compare their performances.

Prolog is a programming language that is commonly used for AI applications, especially in the field of logic programming. It is well-suited for solving puzzles like Sudoku because it can express complex logical constraints and search through large solution spaces efficiently. By implementing different strategies, such as backtracking, constraint propagation, and heuristics, the AI can find the solution to the Sudoku puzzle in the most efficient way possible. Comparing the performances of these strategies can provide insights into which approach is most effective for solving Sudoku puzzles.
